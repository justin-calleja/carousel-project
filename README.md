The code is not hosted openly as per client request. This was a code challenge demo. The code involves 2 React components in separate projects bootstrapped with [https://github.com/insin/nwb](https://github.com/insin/nwb). One is a component for the logic part of a Carousel, the other depends on the previous one and implements the carousel's UI.

The latter component is then depended on by an app bootstrapped with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) which uses the carousel in what you see here: [https://justin-calleja.github.io/carousel-project/](https://justin-calleja.github.io/carousel-project/).
